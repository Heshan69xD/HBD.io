I can't believe how fate brought us back together after all these years 🤷‍♂️.

 It feels like only yesterday we were at the same school 😢, 

and now you're one of the most important people in my life ♥. 

Meeting you again was a big turning point in my life ⭐.

Our little journey over the past few days has been nothing short of amazing 👌.

 From discovering that we have the same dreams and

Vibezz to planning to get the same result in A/Ls as O/Ls 😅 . 

I'm enjoying every single text message coming from you and can't wait to

 see what the future holds for us, especially at our target university 🏆.

You bring so much kindness and positivity into my life, and I'm incredibly

 grateful for your friendship ♥⭐. On this special day,

I wish you all the happiness, love, and success in the path that you

choosed to go. May your birthday be as wonderful and lovely as you are 💖.

Here's to many more memories, adventures, and shared dreams. 

Have an incredible birthday, <strong>Chamodhi</strong>!!! 🎂🎉

With all my best wishes,<br><br>
